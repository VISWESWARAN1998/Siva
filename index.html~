		<h2><u>Chapter-1: Information Gathering</u></h2>
		<p>			Information gathering(in penetration testing) is the act of collecting various valuabe informations from the remote host. The more information we obtain it from a server the more specific an attack can be crafted, vulnerabilities can be exploited. So Siva handles various methodologies to gather the information about the web-server.</p>
